long_description = """<a href="https://qiskit.org/aqua" rel=nofollow>Qiskit Aqua</a> is an extensible,
 modular, open-source library of quantum computing algorithms.
 Researchers can experiment with Aqua algorithms, on near-term quantum devices and simulators,
 and can also get involved by contributing new algorithms and algorithm-supporting objects,
 such as optimizers and variational forms.
 Qiskit Aqua also contains application domain support in the form of Qiskit Chemistry,
 Qiskit Finance, Qiskit Machine Learning and Qiskit Optimization to experiment with real-world applications to quantum computing."""
