=================================================================================

Changed
-------

-   `VQE`, `VQC` and `QSVM` now use parameterized circuits when available to save time
    in transpilation. (#693)
-   Initial stage of ml, finance, and optimization refactor into separate application-specific directories.
    (#700) Among other changes:

-   Deprecate Declarative JSON API. (#720)

Added
-----

-   Ability to create a `CustomCircuitOracle` object with a callback for `evaluate_classically`,
    which a `Grover` object will now check for, upon initialization, on its provided oracle.  (#681)
-   `VariationalForm` and `FeatureMap` have a new property called `support_parameterized_circuit` which
    indicates whether or not the circuit can be built with a Terra `Parameter` (or `ParameterVector`) object.
    Further, the `evolution_instruction` method supports `Parameter` for the time parameter.  (#693)
